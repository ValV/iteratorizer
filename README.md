# Iteratorizer

Function `getNext` inside `App` class is a pseudo-iterator. Initialize like

```kotlin
val app = App(listOf(List(1, 12, 17, 26, 31), listOf(2, 7, 35, 40), listOf(10, 13, 15, 18)))
```

Not really :) Just run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ValV/iteratorizer.git
cd iteratorizer
gradle run
```

This it is and nothing more.
